# Smart Weather Alert Bot

A real-time weather monitoring script that checks your city's forecast and notifies you on Telegram if you need an umbrella.

## What it does
* Connects to the **OpenWeatherMap API**.
* Analyses current temperature and weather conditions (Rain, Clear, Clouds).
* **Logic:** If "Rain" is detected in the forecast, it sends an instant alert to your phone.
* If the weather is clear, it stays silent (or logs to console).

## Tech Stack

* **OpenWeatherMap API**
* **Telegram Bot API**
* **Environment Variables** (Dotenv)
